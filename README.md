# Competitive Programming Tasks and Solutions

Welcome to the repository of competitive programming tasks and their solutions. In this repository, you'll find a collection of challenging programming tasks along with their solutions in Python.

## Task List

### 1. Anagram Hunt

Alex and Morgan are treasure hunters who have found a mysterious note. The note mentions that the treasure can only be unlocked if they find two words in the given string that are anagrams of each other. Write a Python function `find_anagrams(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a tuple `(word1, word2)` representing the pair of anagrams found first.

### 2. Vowel Voyage

Emma and Liam are explorers on a voyage. They discovered an ancient map with instructions encoded in a string. The instructions state that they need to find the longest substring containing only vowels. Write a Python function `vowel_voyage(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest substring consisting of only vowels.

### 3. Word Wizardry

Olivia and Noah are wizards with the power to rearrange words magically. They are given a string containing multiple words. The wizards want to create a new string where each word is reversed, but the order of words remains the same. Write a Python function `word_wizardry(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with reversed words.

### 4. Cipher Challenge

Ava and Oliver stumbled upon an ancient cipher in their quest. The encoded message is a string containing only uppercase letters. Each letter is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. Write a Python function `decipher_message(s, shift)` that takes a string `s` and an integer `shift` as input and returns the deciphered message.

### 5. Substring Secret

Sophia and Jackson found a mysterious substring encoded within a larger string. The substring is repeated multiple times, creating confusion. Write a Python function `find_secret_substring(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the secret substring hidden within the larger string.

### 6. Longest Palindromic Substring

Ethan and Aria are intrigued by palindromes and want to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string. Write a Python function `longest_palindrome(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the longest palindromic substring.

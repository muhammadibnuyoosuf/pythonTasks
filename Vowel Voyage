Task: Vowel Voyage

Emma and Liam are explorers on a voyage. They discovered an ancient map with instructions encoded in a string.
The instructions state that they need to find the longest substring containing only vowels. 
Write a Python function vowel_voyage(s) that takes a string s as input and returns the longest substring consisting of only vowels.

def count_vowels(inputString):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    list_vowel = []
    word_vowel = ''

    for i in range(len(inputString)):
        while i < len(inputString) and inputString[i] in vowels:
            word_vowel += inputString[i]
            i += 1
        list_vowel.append(word_vowel)
        word_vowel = ''

    return max(list_vowel,key=len)

# Example usage:
input_string = "HelloWorldAEIOUExplorers"
result = count_vowels(input_string)
print(result)

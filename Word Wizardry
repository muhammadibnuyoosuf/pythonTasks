Task: Word Wizardry

Olivia and Noah are wizards with the power to rearrange words magically. They are given a string containing multiple words. 
The wizards want to create a new string where each word is reversed, 
but the order of words remains the same. Write a Python function word_wizardry(s) that takes a string s as input and returns a new string with reversed words

def word_wizardry(inputString):
    array_string = inputString.split(" ")
    word =[]


    for item in array_string:
        last_char = item[-1]
        punctuation =""
        if last_char.isalpha() is False:
            punctuation = last_char
            item = item[:-1]
        word.append(item[::-1]+punctuation)
    return " ".join(word)

s = "Hello World, I'm Magic Happens Here"
result = word_wizardry(s)
print(result)
